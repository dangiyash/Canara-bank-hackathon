# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Problem Fixed âœ…

The original error was caused by the app trying to connect to a FastAPI backend (`localhost:8000`) that doesn't exist in Streamlit Cloud. I've modified the `app.py` file to work as a standalone Streamlit application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Mock Data Functions
- `get_mock_account_details()` - Generates account information
- `get_mock_session_status()` - Provides session metrics
- `get_mock_fraud_check()` - Returns security analysis

### 2. Modified API Request Function
- `make_api_request()` now returns mock data instead of making HTTP requests
- No more connection errors to localhost:8000

### 3. Simplified Authentication
- Login now accepts any username/password combination
- No backend authentication required

### 4. Updated Dependencies
- Removed FastAPI, uvicorn, JWT, and other backend packages
- Only kept essential packages: streamlit, pandas, numpy, requests

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Push your changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Streamlit Cloud deployment - remove FastAPI dependency"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Click "New app"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set main file path: `Canara-bank-hackathon/app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Test Locally First

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install streamlit pandas numpy requests

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

## Features That Work

âœ… **Login System** - Any username/password works  
âœ… **Account Dashboard** - Shows balance, transactions, account info  
âœ… **Security Monitor** - Displays risk scores and security metrics  
âœ… **Activity Log** - Session tracking and activity history  
âœ… **Location Detection** - Uses external IP geolocation service  
âœ… **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile and desktop  

## Demo Credentials

- **Username:** Any text (e.g., "demo", "test", "admin")
- **Password:** Any text (e.g., "demo", "password", "123")

## What's Different from Original

- **No FastAPI backend** - Everything runs in Streamlit
- **Mock data** - Uses simulated banking data instead of real APIs
- **Simplified auth** - No JWT tokens or complex authentication
- **Fewer dependencies** - Only 4 packages instead of 12+

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check the logs** in Streamlit Cloud for specific error messages
2. **Verify file paths** - Make sure the main file is `app.py`
3. **Check requirements.txt** - Should only have 4 packages
4. **Clear cache** - Try redeploying the app

## Next Steps After Deployment

Once deployed successfully, you can:
- Customize the mock data to match your needs
- Add real banking API integrations (if available)
- Implement proper user authentication
- Add database connectivity
- Enhance the fraud detection algorithms

The app should now deploy without any connection errors! ðŸŽ‰
